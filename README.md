# Coding Math

This is course taught by Keith Peters ([bit101 on GitHub](https://github.com/bit101)) on the [Coding Math YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@codingmath) and published to his [Coding Math site](http://www.codingmath.com).

It is a great course produced in 2015, thus in pre-ES6 JavaScript. As I watch the videos, I code everything that is shown, but in TypeScript.
